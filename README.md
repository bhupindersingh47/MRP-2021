## Predicting Drought Susceptibility in the US using Meteorological data.



Global temperatures have unequivocally become hotter, and hotter conditions lead to extreme weatherâ€”including 
severe drought. Regionally, the driest parts of the earth are getting drier. This research aims to investigate if droughts 
in the US could be predicted using meteorological data alone. First, an exploratory analysis of the dataset comprised 
of open data offered by the NASA POWER Project and the US Drought Monitor was conducted to determine
characteristics and points of interest. Following this, the dataset was preprocessed to generate suitable feature and 
response matrices for machine learning. Four regression analysis algorithms namely K Nearest Neighbors, Decision 
Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression were trained to predict the drought scores and were evaluated 
using the R<sup>2</sup>, MAE, MSE and RMSE metrics. Random Forest was found to be the best model considering all evaluation 
metrics and run-time. The results show that suitable meteorological data indicators can be used to predict drought 
susceptibility with reasonable accuracy.
